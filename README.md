# BootCleaner
A simple program that cleans your computer's temporary files.

**NOTE: This program is designed to run on your computer's startup, so if you end up using it make sure to make it
execute itself on startup**

Upon executing it'll also create a config.yml file, so you may configure it to your liking.
